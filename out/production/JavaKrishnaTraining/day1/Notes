1. How to print anything in Java
   sout + enter => System.out.println(write whatever you want to print here);

2. How to comment anything in Java  //
    a) you can write explanation about the code you have written
    b) To not execute some piece of your code

3. Variables : Variables are like jars/boxes/containers that can hold/store something

        //How to create variables

        //1. When we know the exact value that we want to store
              //dataType nameOfVariable =value;

        //2. When we don't know the exact value that we want to store
              //dataType nameOfVariable;
4. Data Types: Primitive Data Types [we know advance how much memory it will consume]
    non-decimal number : byte(1)/short(2)/int(4)/long(8)
    decimal number     : float(4)/double(8)
    character          : char(2)
    boolean            : boolean(~1 bit)
    1 byte = 8 bits

    Non-Primitive Data Types [we don't know advance how much memory it will consume]
