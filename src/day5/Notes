Statements: Helps us in making decisions
if else statement    [We use this when we have to make single decision]
if(defineCondition)
{
    code here will execute only if condition is true
}
else
{
    code here will execute only if condition is false
}




if else if statement [We use this when we have to make multiple decisions]

if(defineCondition1)
{
    code here will execute only if condition1 is true
}
else if(defineCondition2)
{
   code here will execute only if condition2 is true
}
else if(defineCondition3)
{
   code here will execute only if condition3 is true
}
else if(defineCondition4)
{
   code here will execute only if condition4 is true
}
else
{
    code here will execute only if none of the above conditions is true
}

switch statement     [We use this when we have to make multiple decisions] --> faster

switch(variableToSwitchOver)
{
    case a:
      action;
      break;
          case b:
            action;
            break;
                case c:
                  action;
                  break;
                  default:
                    action
}
